[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/78b72c73-8619-4435-a052-f43403b0ecbf/branches/distribution/badge)](http://adfoc.us/5869871)

Simple third-party application for browsing nhentai.net.

> Just a little app for Android

## Recent changes: Visual Studio App Center

### Data collection

The app now uses [Visual Studio App Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hant/app-center/) to provide in-app update, app analysis, and crashes report. 
To enable these features, some data will be collected from you (the user) and sent to App Center. You can find the details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/data-collected).

As it might be a concern to some users, a new option is added in the settings page for disabling in-app update. 

### Better auto-update

Instead of using Firebase's remote config to handle update checking manually, the app now uses [Visual Studio App Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hant/app-center/) to handle it automatically (well, kind of...). <u>This feature will also be disabled along with disabling in-app update.</u>

### Icon (Version 2) & Splash screen

I would like to include NHentai‚Äôs icon and slogan in this project since it is an application about their site.  
I have sent them an email to ask for permission but there is still no reply yet.  
Please contact me if there are any issue, thanks.

## Getting Started

The application is using the [JSON API](https://github.com/NHMoeDev/NHentai-android/issues/27) (page was removedüò•) and parse the response data into Java class from version 2.
